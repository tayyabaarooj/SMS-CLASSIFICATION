# SMS-CLASSIFICATION
SMS Spam Classifier is our semester project (Course Project- Natural language processing)
In collboration with Haassan Farid (ClassMate)
# Project Structure
sms_spam_classifier.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the SMS spam classifier model.
data/: The folder containing the dataset used for training and testing.
models/: Folder to save trained models.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.
# Features
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF) to prepare the SMS messages for training.

Model Training: Trained with various models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression.

Evaluation: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics are used to evaluate model performance.

Model Inference: A simple function that allows classifying new SMS messages as spam or not spam.
